                        I was born and raised in San Francisco and left The Bay for the first time when I went to college. I graduated from Cornell University and in those four years, I learned a lot about society, culture, and the power of voice. After graduation, I moved back to San Francisco and taught Pre-K for two years before moving to Campbell, CA. I currently work at Braven, an education nonprofit that is working to help talented, diverse college students develop leadership and career-related skills. I am passionate about diversifying our nationâ€™s talent pipeline and deeply believe in the power of community.
